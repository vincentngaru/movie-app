# AR589 Starter Project

This starter project is made to get you up and running quickly. It includes [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io), and a custom made `toggleClass` JavaScript function that you can learn how to use in the comments of the `/javascript/toggleClass.js` file.

## Getting Started

To use this starter, simply [download it](https://github.com/AR589/starter/archive/master.zip). Be sure to rename the folder and make it a Git repository before you start working.

## Starting a Server

When working you should always start a local server so you can be sure that all of your links and image paths will work correctly when put you put your site on a web server. The local server only needs to be running while you're working â€” it is specific to your computer.

If you're using the [Atom](http://atom.io) code editor, install the [atom-live-server package](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server). If you're not sure how to install packages in Atom, you can [learn how in the documentation](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/).

## Where to Code

### HTML

Your "home page" is `index.html`. You can as many `.html` documents to your project as you like.

### CSS

Write your CSS styles in `/css/main.css`. All styles written there will override the included Tachyons styles.

### JavaScript

Write your JavaScript in `/javascript/main.js`.
